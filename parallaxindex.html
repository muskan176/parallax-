            From a sustainable marketing perspective, the fundamental relationship between humans and nature is the ongoing exchange and change of resources, the service nature and humans provide to each other: We tend to consume as if there is an unlimited supply of resources, but we live in a world of non-renewable resources

            In Part I derivation is given of the current and emf deflection constants of the galvanometer, and the application is shown of these constants to a short method of calculating deflections at critical damping. An analogous method is also shown for calculating deflections at a specified damping other than critical. Part II includes a presentation and proof of basic formulas with correction factors for calculation of available current or available emf at the galvanometer terminals of the unbalanced Wheatstone bridge and of the current through the galvanometer branch.

        <p> The applicability of these formulas to the Kelvin double bridge is shown, also their applicability to the single bridge when the unbalance is caused by deviations in more than one arm. Criteria are stated for combining bridge and galvanometer, and a new rule is presented for determining the preferred location of galvanometer and battery in a Wheatstone bridge.</p>
